# KDTrees

KDTrees is a program that implements a **Generic K-Dimensional Tree** to store points in K-Dimensional space with basic operations and **K-Nearest Neighbour Lookup**. This assignment is provided by Stanford University's CS106L course. Although I'm not a student or alumni of Stanford university, this is my implementation of the KD-Tree that I did for fun!

## Installation

To run this program, you need Qt Creator installed with MinGW compiler
